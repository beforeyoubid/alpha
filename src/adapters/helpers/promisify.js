    // 2) If fn is callback style, it'll call resolve/reject in the callback
    // function above which in turn resolves this promise. Because resolve/reject
    // were called in the callback, .then() will also call the same resolve or
    // reject a second time. However, this is okay because calling resolve/reject
    // multiple times is a no-opt.
